            <h1>ORIGIN OF THE WORD “COCKTAIL”</h1>

            <p>
                There is debate about when the term was first used. According the
                <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/1256/the-surprising-history-of-the-cocktail.html">
                    The London Telegraph
                </a>,
                the word is first found in print in a March 20, 1798 satirical newspaper article.
            </p>

            <p>
                Others point to an April 28, 1803 article from The Farmer’s Cabinet in Vermont,
                where to drink a cocktail was claimed to be “excellent for the head.”
            </p>

            <div class="color">
                <p id="guarantee">
                    Regardless, certainly by 1806, the word was being used with its current meaning.
                    <a href="http://www.chowhound.com/food-news/54845/whats-the-origin-of-the-word-cocktail/">
                        “a stimulating liquor composed of spirits of any kind – sugar, water, and bitters.”
                    </a>
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                During the early 17th century, an animal, particularly a horse,
                with a docked tail, was said to have a “cock tail.”
